Read Me:

This is a generic multi-purpose timer that can be added to any scene for instant functionality.

--To add a timer to a scene select "GameObject/UI/Timer" from the Toolbar or right-click in the Hierachy and select "UI/Timer".

--The timer uses the default uGUI components and can be adjusted to suit your needs.

--Methods have been added to control the timer from your other scripts, you can now make a reference to the timer and call the following:

GetTimerValue()     returns the unformatted float value used for timer.
RestartTimer()      resets the timer.
StopTimer()         pause or stop the timer.
StartTimer()        starts the timer.

Use the Inspector:

--Timer State: disable or enable timer counting.

--Timer Text: A reference to the text used for the timer string.

--Timer Type: Select if you want the timer to Count Down, Count Up, or Count Up No Limit.

--Finish Time: Used when timer is counting up, if not the finish time is 0.

--Start Time: Used when timer is counting down, if not the finish time is 0.

--Timer Format: Used when timer is counting up or down. Choose which parameters of the timer string are displayed: milliseconds, seconds, minutes

--Display Options: Used when timer is set to count up infinite. Choose which parameters of the timer string are displayed: milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days

--Set Zero Timescale: sets the timescale to 0 when times up.

--Times Up Event: Assign functions to be called on assigned objects when times up.

--Destroy On Finish: Destroy(GameObject) will be called on all assigned game objects.

--Load Scene On: Select if you want a scene to be loaded automatically on time up or at a specific time.

--Analog Clocks - 3D and uGUI analog clock prefabs are included that will automatically read and display the time from the timer asset when counting up infinitely. Just add these to a scene with the timer asset.
